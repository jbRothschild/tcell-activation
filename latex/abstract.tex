T cells are activated by antigen concentrations and undergo a stage of proliferation until a moment where their concentration peaks and then immediately decays (in a linear fashion). This resembles an excitable system. Anton and co. have been thinking of different models that express this behaviour and would like to test this model under different conditions to find if it exhibits similar dynamics as what is observed expereimentally. Let's try things...
