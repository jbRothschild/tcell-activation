At the moment antigen appears in the system, they get detected by T cells who become activated. These T cells start producing cytokine IL-2 which itself starts recruiting other agents of the immune system. This IL-2 is picked up by T cells who start to actively proliferate. It's also picked up by T reg T cells (who deplete the quantity of cytokine). The proliferating T cells decrease the concentration of antigen until there is no more.

Experimentally, observations show that after 24 hours of certain antigen levels being present, there is a linear increase of proliferating T cells until a couple days in. After this time, the concentration of proliferating T cells starts to suddenly decrease linearly until there are no more. It is unclear how this all works out.
